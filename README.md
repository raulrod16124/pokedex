## ðŸŒŸ Description

Pokedex App is a mobile application designed for PokÃ©mon enthusiasts like me. It allows users to search, filter, and view detailed information about PokÃ©mon, including abilities, types, and stats, presented in a clean and interactive format. This app is built with **React Native** and **TypeScript**, making it performant and compatible across iOS and Android devices. 

With **react-native-paper** providing a consistent and accessible design, and **Jest** ensuring functionality with reliable testing, Pokedex App is a fun, informative, and visually engaging tool for both casual fans and dedicated PokÃ©mon trainers.
